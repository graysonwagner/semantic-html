# Code Refactor Starter Code


## Description
The Agency's website was functional, but not accessible.
By rewiring the code to meet accessibility standards, the website is now way more user friendly and available for viewing

## Tasks

-Adding alt image attributes
-Correct heading sequence
-Creating title 
-Link function
-Semantic refactoring
-Element restructuring

## What I learned 

-Using semantics enhances the ability of readers to interpret the content for the user. 

-Even if the code looks good and works that doesnt mean its the best version of it, it can always be refactored and cleaned up.

## Future improvements to the site

-Possible re coloring and branding 

-More navigation link functionality
